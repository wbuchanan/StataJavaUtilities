# Stata Java Utilities
Classes that should hopefully make it easier for others to use the Java API 
available in Stata.  This repository contains classes and methods that will 
allow you to construct a complete representation of a Stata dataset (loaded 
into the current Stata session) on the JVM including: variable labels, value 
labels, variable names, value label names, the data, etc....  

# Additional Information
These classes and methods were derived from work I started on building out a 
[JSON serializer/deserializer in Stata.](https://wbuchanan.github.io/StataJSON/about/)
